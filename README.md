# SnAkE

During MLH Global Hackweek API, I made a snake game using Python and Pygame. I followed along during the livestream and was successful in creating the game. The game, Snake, is a classic game where the player controls a snake that grows longer as it eats fruit. The goal is to eat as much fruit as possible without running into walls or the snake’s own body. I was able to add a feature where the snake sped up each time it ate a fruit. I don’t have much experience with Python, but this was a nice refresher from the last time I used it. It was cool that I was able to get a working game in a short amount of time.
